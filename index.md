# Keypad and Fingerprint Safe
My project is a keypad and fingerprint ID safe. The box has a keypad and fingerprint scanner on it. After the person correctly puts in the password and fingerprint, the box will open and they will be able to retrieve their belongings. Otherwise, the box will remain locked.

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone -->

# First Milestone

For my first milestone, I wired up the keypad and servo onto the arduino. I used C++ in Arduino IDE on my computer to upload code. I mapped the button "1" to make the servo move 180 degrees clockwise and "2" to make the servo move 180 degrees counterclockwise so that the servo would spin accordingly when the respective buttons on the keypad were pressed. I also made the computer print out the value of whatever button I pressed. Some challeges that I faced were how much the arduino could handle. At first, I had the servo just constantly spinning, which made the keypad stop working whenever the servo was active. It also kept forcing my computer to shut down. To fix this, I added a battery pack to provide more power so that the arduino wouldn't have to only draw power from the computer and made the servo only spin a set amount when a button was clicked.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)

# Starter Project
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4P4u2elmVI?si=ZLH9Rz3OYL4tvI35" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

My starter project is the Mini Arcade Console. It works by receiving input from buttons being pressed and using that to update the LED displays that make up the screen that shows the game. All of the components (ex. LED displays, buzzer, buttons) are soldered together and connected to a battery pack to provide power. The player can choose between a few different games, such as Tetris or Snake, and the system records the player's score. This project mainly taught me better soldering skills.
